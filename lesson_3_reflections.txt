Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks: are clones of remote repositories on GitHub; use if you do not have permission to collaborate (leaves remote repository unchanged)
	clones: are local copies of (local/remote) repositories; use to collaborate with others (allows to push/pull changes to common repository)
	branches: are series of commits leaving the master branch unchanged; use for experimental commits deviating from the main/master branch (e.g. to add features)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	it allows to track what changes have occurred on remote since the last sync, which facilitates merging local and remote copies

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	GitHub is fantastic
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	for experimental features, keep master branch working, when collaborating with others
