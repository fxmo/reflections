How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff highlights the locations in both files where content was added or deleted

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it allows to track changes in all files, which could help identifying when 
	and where bugs were introduced (by going back to the last working version)

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro: ensuring the commit time captures a full logical changes
	con: burden to decide the right commit time, could be forgotten

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is a decidated version control system to be used for programming

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the list of committed changes, diff log highlights the changes
	between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    as git keeps track of the history of changes, i can always return to a working 
	version of the code files

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    organising a programming project
